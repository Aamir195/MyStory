        "story": "Once Emperor Akbar became very angry at his favourite minister Birbal. He asked Birbal to leave the kingdom and go away. Accepting the command of the Emperor, Birbal left the kingdom and started working in a farmer’s farm in an unknown village far away under a different identity.\nAs months passed, Akbar started to miss Birbal. He was struggling to solve many issues in the empire without Birbal’s advice. He regretted a decision, asking Birbal to leave the empire in anger. So, Akbar sent his soldiers to find Birbal, but they failed to find him. No one knew where Birbal was. Akbar finally found a trick. He sent a message to the head of every village to send a pot full of the wit to the Emperor. If the pot full of wit cannot be sent, fill the pot with diamonds and jewels.\nThis message also reached Birbal, who lived in one of the villages. The people of the village got together. All started talking about what to do now? The wit is not a thing, which can be filled in the pot. How will we arrange for diamonds and jewels to fill the pot and send to the Emperor? Birbal who was sitting among the villagers said, \"Give me the pot, I will fill the wit in one month’s end.\" Everyone trusted Birbal and agreed to give him a chance. They still didn't know his identity.\nBirbal took the pot with him and went back to the farm. He had planted watermelons on his farm. He selected a small watermelon and without cutting it from the plant, he put that in the pot. He started looking after it by providing water and fertilizer regularly. Within a few days, the watermelon grew into a pot so much that it was impossible to get it out of the pot.\nSoon, the watermelon reached to the same size as the pot from inside. Birbal then cut the watermelon from the vine and separated it with the pot. Later, he sent a pot to Emperor Akbar with a message that \"Please remove the wit without cutting it from the pot and without breaking the pot.\"\nAkbar watched the watermelon in the pot and realized that this can only be Birbal’s Work. Akbar himself came to the village, took Birbal back with him.\n",

        "story": "Even as a child, he would run away from his lessons and his tutors in order to go riding and hunting. When he grew up, he was a better rider and a more fearless hunter than any of his courtiers. One day while chasing a tiger, Akbar and few brave soldiers rode so fast that they left all the others behind. They had gone a long distance from the royal capital at Agra and, as evening came, they realized that they were lost. They were hungry and tired. Finally, they reached a place where three roads met.\"Ah at last we found a way\", the emperor exclaimed. Then, turning to his men, he asked, \"Which way shall we go? Which road leads to Agra? All the roads look the same\". It was hard to tell which road led to Agra. Just then, a young man came walking down one of the roads. Seeing him Emperor's men called out to him and ordered him to come forward. He did so, looking up at the richly-dressed hunters with bright eyes. \"Tell us, boy\", said Emperor Akbar, \"which road goes to Agra?\" Keep reading how Akbar and Birbal met.Young man began to smile. \"Huzoor, everybody knows that roads cannot move. How can this road go to Agra, or go anywhere else?\" he said, and he chuckled delightedly at his own joke.\nThere was absolute silence. Emperor stared down at the youth. His soldiers held their breath. They knew their emperor's temper. Not one of them dared to say a single word.\nYoung men said, \"People travel, not the roads, do they?\"\n\"No, they don't\", answered emperor and suddenly began to laugh. Nervously, his soldiers began to laugh too. The youth ignored them and continued to look up at the emperor with twinkling eyes.\"What's your name?\" Emperor Akbar asked the young man.\"Mahesh Das\", he replied. \"And what is your name, Huzoor?\" The emperor pulled off an enormous emerald ring which he wore on his hand. Leaning down, he gave it to the young man.\n\"You are speaking to Akbar, Emperor of Hindustan (India)\", he said. \"We need fearless young men such as you at our court, Mahesh Das ( Future Birbal). Bring this ring with you when you come, and I shall recognize and remember you. And now, show us the road we must take in order to get to Agra\". Mahesh Das bowed low and pointed towards the capital. Emperor turned his horse and galloped away, followed by his soldiers.This is how Akbar and Birbal met.",

        "story": "When Mahesh became a young man, he took few coins which were all his savings, along with the Ring of the Royal Seal, kissed his mother farewell, and set out upon the long road to the new capital of Empire, Fatehpur Sikri. He walked a long way and finally reached red walls of the palace. The palace gate was so large and so richly ornamented, Mahesh thought it must be the door to the Emperors own room. But it was far from that. Beautiful as it was, it was merely the outermost edge of the great city within a city, which was the Imperial Court.\nSoon the guard on duty noticed the astonished gaze of this simple-looking country boy, he slashed the air with his spear and barred Maheshs path. Keep reading more for Mahesh Das fortune  How they met  Part 2.\nWhere do you think youre going? asked the guard.\nI have come to see the King, said Mahesh mildly.\nMaking fun of him the guard continued, Oh, have you? How very fortunate. His Majesty has been wondering when you would come. \nMahesh replied,Yes, well, now Im here, let me pass.\nFool ! Shenshah Akbar is very busy, Go away! Mahesh looked at the quivering moustaches of this arrogant warrior and half-smiled.\nSeeing the situation Mahesh started polishing him, Please, brother let me go. I know when you were young, no doubt you fought wonderfully on the Emperors frontiers but now that they have given you this easy job  why do you want to risk it? The guard became furious and as he was about to hit him, he stopped short as Mahesh held out Akbars ring. Even a guard could recognize the Imperial Seal.Mahesh then said, Our good King receives all who come to see him. Many years ago he had sent for me. Now let me pass.The guard was very annoyed as now he has to let the young man pass, but he was unwilling to let him go. You can pass on one condition, he scowled. If you obtain anything from the Emperor, you will give half to me. Agreed, smiled Mahesh, and went by.\nShade trees rocked with the breeze as Mahesh followed the path through the royal gardens. Each building he passed seemed more magnificent than the last. Finally, he reached the hall of public audience. Seeing so many richly dressed courtiers his heart pounded as he felt that he was not properly dressed in order to meet the king.\nBut at last he saw Akbar, seated upon a throne of gold which was studded with flashing gems, a man of simple elegance. He needed to look no further.Pushing past the generals, Rajput princes, and Persian artists, Mahesh presented himself before the throne and caught the Emperors gaze.\nHe praised King Akbar by saying, Sire, may your shadow never grow less, O Full Moon! I have come at your command, which none dare disobey.\nAnd he handed back the Emperor the ring which he had given to that country boy so many years back. Akbar laughed with pleasure. Welcome, welcome. What can I do for you? What can I give you? What is that your hearts desire?\nThe courtiers hushed at this unusually generous reception by the King. Who was this shabby-looking young man? Mahesh thought for a moment and then said, I would like you to punish me with one hundred lashes.What! exploded the king. A hundred lashes? But you have done nothing wrong! \nMahesh then said, Will Your Majesty go back on his promise to fulfill my hearts desire?\nWell, no- a King must always keep his word�replied Akbar.\nSo, with great reluctance, Akbar ordered Maheshs back to be stripped and a hundred lashes of whip to be laid upon him by the court executioner. To the acute interest of all the assembled courtiers, Mahesh endured every stroke with a stony expression, and without uttering a sound.\nBut when the whip had cracked for the fiftieth time (50th), he suddenly jumped up and shouted: Stop! Ah! cried Akbar. Then you see how foolish you are being.No, Sire. It is only that when I came here to see you, I was unable to enter the Palace, unless I promised the guard at the front gate half of whatever I get from the Kings generosity. So I have taken my half of the hundred lashes. Please be kind enough to deliver the rest of them to him.\nThe entire crowd shouted with laughter, and Akbar loudest of all. His fingers snapped, and the unhappy guard was hauled into the presence chamber to receive his humiliating bribe.\nWhen he was dragged out in disgrace, Akbar turned to Mahesh and said, You are a brave-heart like you were when you were a child and you have grown even cleverer. I have tried in many ways to weed out corruption at my Court, but your little trick today will make greedy officials honest. From now on, since you are so wise, you shall be called Birbal, the courageous one. And you shall stay by my side and advice me in all court matters.",

        "story": "The wisdom of Birbal was unparalleled during the reign of Emperor Akbar. But Akbars brother in law was extremely jealous of him. He asked the Emperor to dispense with Birbals services and appoint him in his place. He gave ample assurance that he would prove to be more efficient and capable than Birbal. Before Akbar could take a decision on this matter, this news reached Birbal.\nBirbal resigned and left. Akbars brother in law was made the minister in place of Birbal. Akbar decided to test the new minister. He gave three hundred gold coins to him and said, Spend these gold coins such that, I get a hundred gold coins here in this life; a hundred gold coins in the other world and another hundred gold coins neither here nor there.\nThe minister found the entire situation to be a maze of confusion and hopelessness. He spent sleepless nights worrying how he would get himself out of this mess. Thinking in circles was making him go crazy. Eventually, on the advice of his wife, he sought Birbals help. Birbal said, Just give me the gold coins. I shall handle the rest.\nBirbal walked the streets of the city holding the bag of gold coins in his hand. He noticed a rich merchant celebrating his sons wedding. Birbal gave a hundred gold coins to him and bowed courteously saying, Emperor Akbar sends you his good wishes and blessings for the wedding of your son. Please accept the gift he has sent. The merchant felt honored that the king had sent a special messenger with such a precious gift. He honored Birbal and gave him a large number of expensive gifts and a bag of gold coins as a return gift for the king.\nNext, Birbal went to the area of the city where the poor people lived. There he bought food and clothing in exchange for a hundred gold coins and distributed them in the name of the Emperor.\nWhen he came back to town he organized a concert of music and dance. He spent a hundred gold coins on it.\nThe next day Birbal entered Akbars darbar and announced that he had done all that the king had asked his brother-in-law to do. The Emperor wanted to know how he had done it. Birbal repeated the sequences of all the events and then said, The money I gave to the merchant for the wedding of his son  you have got back while on this earth. The money I spent on buying food and clothing for the poor  you will get it in the other world. The money I spent on the musical concert  you will get neither here nor there. Akbars brother in law understood his mistake and resigned. Birbal got his place back.\n",

Now this courtier always wanted to be chief minister, but this was not possible as Birbal filled that position.  One day Akbar praised Birbal in front of the courtier. This made the courtier very angry and he said that the king praised Birbal unjustly and if Birbal could answer three of his questions, he would accept the fact that Birbal was intelligent. Akbar always wanting to test Birbals wit readily agreed.\nThe three questions were\n1. How many stars are there in the sky\n2. Where is the centre of the Earth and\n3. How many men and how many women are there in the world.\nImmediately Akbar asked Birbal the three questions and informed him that if he could not answer them, he would have to resign as chief minister.\nTo answer the first question, Birbal brought a hairy sheep and said, There are as many stars in the sky as there is hair on the sheeps body. My friend the courtier is welcome to count them if he likes.\nTo answer the second question, Birbal drew a couple of lines on the floor and bore an iron rod in it and said, this is the centre of the Earth, the courtier may measure it himself if he has any doubts.\nIn answer to the third question, Birbal said, Counting the exact number of men and women in the world would be a problem as there are some specimens like our courtier friend here who cannot easily be classified as either. Therefore, if all people like him are killed, then and only then can one count the exact number.\n",

        "story": "As we all know, Birbal was not only Emperor Akbars favourite minister but also a minister dearly loved by most of the commoners, because of his ready wit and wisdom. People used to come to him from far and wide for advice on personal matters too.  However, there was a group of ministers that were jealous of his growing popularity and disliked him intensely. They outwardly showered him with praise and compliments, but on the inside, they began to hatch a plot to kill him.\nOne day they approached the kings barber with a plan. As the barber was extremely close to the king, they asked him to help them get rid of Birbal permanently. And of course, they promised him a huge sum of money in return. The wicked barber readily agreed.\nThe next time the king required his services, the barber started a conversation about the emperors father who he also used to serve. He sang praises of his fine, silky-smooth hair. And then as an afterthought, he asked the king that as he was enjoying such great prosperity, had he made an attempt to do anything for the welfare of his ancestors?\nThe king was furious at such impertinent stupidity and told the barber that it was not possible to do anything because they were already dead. The barber mentioned that he knew of a magician who could come of help. The magician could send a person up to heaven to enquire about his fathers welfare. But of course, this person would have to be chosen carefully; he would have to be intelligent enough to follow the magicians instructions as well as make on-the-spot decisions. He must be wise, intelligent and responsible. The barber then suggested the best person for the job  the wisest of all ministers, Birbal.\nThe king was very excited about hearing from his dead father and asked the barber to go ahead and make the arrangements immediately. He asked him what was needed to be done. The barber explained that they would take Birbal in a procession to the burial grounds and light a pyre. The magician would then chant some mantras as Birbal would ascend to the heavens through the smoke. The chanting would help protect Birbal from the fire.\nThe king happily informed Birbal of this plan. Birbal said that he thought it a brilliant idea and wanted to know the brain behind it. When learning that it was the barbers idea, he agreed to go to heaven on condition that he be given a large sum of money for the long journey as well as one months time to settle his family so that they had no trouble while he was gone. The king agreed to both conditions.\nIn the duration of this month, he got a few trustworthy men to build a tunnel from the funeral grounds to his house. And on the day of the ascension, after the pyre had been lit, Birbal escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel. He disappeared into his house where he hid for a few months while his hair and beard grew long and unruly.\nIn the meantime, his enemies were rejoicing as they thought that they had seen the last of Birbal.  Then one day after many, many months Birbal arrived at the palace with news of the kings father. The king was extremely pleased to see him and ready with a barrage of questions. Birbal told the king that his father was in the best of spirits and had been provided with all the comforts except one.\nThe king wanted to know what was lacking because now he thought he had found a way to send things and people to heaven. Birbal answered that there were no barbers in heaven, which is why even he was forced to grow his own beard. He said that his father had asked for a good barber.\nSo, the king decided to send his own barber to serve his father in heaven. He called both the barber and the magician to prepare to send him to heaven. The barber could say absolutely nothing in his own defence as he was caught in his own trap. And once the pyre was lit, he died on the spot.\nNobody dared to conspire against Birbal again.\n",
